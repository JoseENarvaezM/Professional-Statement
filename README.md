My name is José Esteban Narváez, and I am a Systems Engineering student in the final stage of my degree, with a strong foundation in networking, software development, and data analysis. I am highly motivated by the field of cybersecurity, especially the challenge of protecting sensitive data and digital infrastructures in a constantly evolving technological landscape. I value ethical responsibility, continuous learning, and teamwork — principles that guide my academic and professional journey. My strengths in technical problem-solving, structured thinking, and collaborative work enable me to support an organization’s security goals by identifying vulnerabilities, reducing risks, and contributing to the development of robust and resilient systems.
